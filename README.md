Project done in order to do an OpenWebinars (https://openwebinars.net/academia/) course, exactly this one: "API Rest con Node JS y Express: Endpoint". A basic crud has been done, with controllers, routes and model. Using Express.

2nd Update:
Second version of the project, now including JWT, secured endpoints, and file management (images can now be uploaded and you can also do a GET of them). This was done following the OpenWebinars course "API Rest con Node JS y Express: JWT y ficheros". This ends the learning with this backend.

The documentation of the endpoints is here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/31313610/2s9YeBdZ81
